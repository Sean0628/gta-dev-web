## Data Management

### Adding New Meetups

To add a new meetup:

1. Open `src/data/meetups.ts`
2. Add a new entry to the `meetupSources` array:

```typescript
export const meetupSources: MeetupSource[] = [
  {
    url: "https://www.meetup.com/your-meetup-group/",
    platform: "meetup", // or "other"
    type: "meetups", // or "others"
  }
];
```

Supported platforms:
- `meetup`: Meetup.com groups
- `other`: Custom websites/platforms

Types:
- `meetups`: Regular meetup groups
- `others`: Other tech communities or events

### Scraping Process

The project includes an automated scraper to keep meetup information up-to-date:

1. Run the scraper:
```bash
npm run scrape
npm run scrape:meetups // Run meetup scraping
npm run scrape:events  // Run event scraping
```

The scraper will:
- Check for new meetups in `meetupSources`
- Update existing meetup information
- Store logos and descriptions
- Track last scrape time

To customize scraping for a new platform:
1. Add the platform's URL pattern to `scrapeMeetupPage()` in `scripts/*`
2. Implement the scraping logic using Cheerio selectors
3. Return the scraped data in the standard format
